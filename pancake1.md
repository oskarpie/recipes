## BASIC DRY PANCAKE MIX

Why buy a store-bought mix when homemade pancakes are so easy and so much better? You can use this mix immediately after putting it together or, better yet, do what I do: make a quadruple batch and store it in an airtight container in the pantry. That way, whenever you want to whip up a batch of pancakes, all you've got to do is add your wet ingredients, and you're ready to roll.

> Note: This recipe can be scaled up to any size.

Makes about 2 cups, enough for approximately 16 pancakes.

- 10 ounces (2 cups) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon

Combine all the ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk until homogeneous. Transfer to an airtight container. The mix will stay good for 3 months.

## LIGHT AND FLUFFY BUTTERMILK PANCAKE

Makes 16 pancakes, serving 4 to 6.

> Note: The sour cream can be replaced with more buttermilk.

- 1 recipe Basic Dry Pancake Mix (above)
- 2 large eggs, separated
- 1½ cups buttermilk
- 1 cup sour cream (see Note above)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- Butter or oil for cooking
- Warm maple syrup and butter

1. Place the dry mix in a large bowl.
2. In a medium clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogeneous. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking. Carefully fold in the egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined. Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps).
3. Heat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. Use a ¼-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and butter
